## Project Name: THE KNOW

#### Check In (what checkin number is this?): 1

#### Project Pitch

As a nomad, I've lived in a lot of cities. But every time I move to a new city, I don't know where to look for the happenings around my new town. So I want to build a modern and 'hipster-approved/built' event application. 

### Deliverables

#### Stack: React.js, Redux, React Router

#### APIs: Eventful API (http://api.eventful.com/)

#### Wireframes

#### Waffle & Github

#### Order Of Attack
Iteration 0
* Build a Welcome page with a search that can find location
* Based on location entered, Main page automatically loads events that are happening that week

Iteration 1 
* User can click on categories and it filters results by category

Iteration 2
* User can then filter those categories based on when they are going to happen

Iteration 3 
* User can search for any type of event they want

#### MVP
* User can search for events happening in their city (Ideally the location will load automatically based off of where the user is currently)
* User can choose a category to filter their search
* User can search for events by keyword
* User can filter results by when they are happening
* User can favorite an event. 

#### Nice To Haves
* User can create an account 
* User can log in
* User can save events that they are interested in
* User can logout and login and have their saved events persist
* Saved events are organized by 'past events' and 'upcoming events'

#### Biggest Challenges
* Dealing with all the search features and really being able to maximize the capabilities

#### Instructor Notes

#### Deliverables for next checkin:

- Have the rest of your wireframes submitted 
- Have react, router, and redux setup 
- Have store populated with initial data. 
- Start test driving your API utility. 
- Have initial landing page built out.
